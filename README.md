# Engineering Science Program at Pitt-collaborative Platform

## Introduction

<p> Hi! Welcome to Pitt Engineering Science Program collaborative Platform. The purposes of this platform are:

- Create a community that everyone can share, edit, and corporate their project.
- Provide a guide for people who are interested in website development.
- Look for some contributors who can update the Engineering Science website.

<p> What will you achieve in engaging in this github community?<p>

- Website development coding experience .
  <br>(Website coding has major difference with coding related to data analysis which you may encounter very often in Engineering courses. It is very visualized so every creativity you conveyed into code will be recognized. )

- Find friends who share similar interest in certain website developments.

## To get started

<p>You will need some handy coding softwares for enjoyable coding experience. There are two softwares that I recommend using:<p>

- Notepad++
- Visual Studio Code

Notepad++ interface is very neat and user-friendly. HTML and CSS coding can be handled very efficiently in this software.

Visual Studio Code is very good at code formatting and javascript coding with certain extensions.

## Coding Languages

There is three languages you need to learn to achieve front-end website development:

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript (If you are not satisfied with limited interactivity that CSS can provide.)

Don't be scared by them !!! HTML and CSS are not technically speaking programming languages which means there is not much logic other than syntax you need to learn two master both languages. Trust me. You can create a awesome website with only HTML and CSS.

### HTML

HTML (The HyperText Markup Language) is like the construct of a vehicle. Your code determines how your website look like in the most part.
Here is the course I recommend to take on Linked in Learning:

### CSS

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is like the exterior of a vehicle. Your code decorate the website upon HTML.

### JavaScript

JavaScript is like the control panel of a vehicle, which builds a bridge between HTML and CSS and embed logic in those "brainless" markup languages. If you can master Javascript, sky is the limit for your websites. Here is the course I recommend to take on Linked in Learning:

## Open resources for web developers

W3C Schools is good in providing HTML,CSS and JS syntaxs, demos for certain functions.

MDN Web Docs is a comprehensive coding syntax library. You will find it very useful in JavaScript coding.

## In terms of JavaScript Libraries

One of the misconceptions about JS libraries is that these libraries are shortcut of Vanilla JavaScript. That is not right. You may be able to get some well-built code "package" to achieve certain functions, but you are not capable of or will struggle adjusting those code to fit the function perfectly in your project. The JavaScript Library syntax vary from one to another. So it will be very hard for you to learn those syntax if you are not familiar with Vanilla Javascript.

However, JavaScript libraries will become handy to achieve certain complex functions. Here are a list of Javascript libraries you may find easy to use:

- jQuery-Website interactivity

- anime.js-Webiste animation
- TensorFlow.js-Machine Learning

## Create your own Github repository

There are several major things you would like to learn to make the most out of Github:

1. Create your own repository and manage the repository.
1. Push and commit the code to the Github repository.
1. Host your website on Github.
